            <p>
                Hi! I'm Simon Wheeler and am a Help desk analyst and web developer. Currently 
                working as a contractor with Quest Diagnostics through HCL Tech. Before this 
                I was a bartender for 13 years and then during lock down I decided to 
                study and get a certificate to change fields. After a month I was able 
                able to get my A+ certificate and then a over a another month able to 
                get my first IT job as a help desk analyst.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been working on changing me career and started learning Full-Stack 
                Development. Decided that I didn't want to be stuck at the help desk and 
                want to do more. After trying different things I decided on development 
                as it is fun and I enjoy doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning development, has had me work on many different projects. Below 
                are some of my best ones. There is also a link to my other ones.
            </p>
